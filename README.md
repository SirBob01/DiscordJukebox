# Discord Jukebox

A Discord music bot to replace Groovy and Rhythm in my friends' servers, taken so soon by the corporate overlords at Youtube (RIP).

This supports most of the basic features of the original bots.

## TODO
- Add pagination to the `queue` command
- Display the thumbnail of the current track for `now` and `queue` commands
- Display current track timestamp for `now` and `queue` commands
